Start parsing by providing input file name:
$> java Main <inputfile.graphml>
adding Options:
 -a <outputfile.graphml>        Print all graph calculations and node/edge
                                properties to a new *.graphml file.
                                Provide file name and path.
 -b <node_id>                   Calculate the betweenness centrality measure for
                                a selected node.
                                Provide a Node id.
 -c                             Checks whether the the graph is connected.
 -d                             Calculate diameter of the graph.
 -G,--graph                     Print # of nodes and edges.
 -h,--help                      Print this help text.
 -s <1st node_id 2nd node_id>   Calculate the shortest path between two vertices
                                according to the Dijkstra algorithm.
